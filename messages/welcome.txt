Congratulations!!!

You have done next step to Zen.

Zen Tabs is a Sublime Text 2 plugin that helps you to keep you tab bar in Zen.

You have to do nothing now. You just need to set opened tabs limit(default 10 or even 1) and enjoy. When you will open [limited_tabs_count + 1] tab the oldest one will be closed. That's all. 


New features are coming.
